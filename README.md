My definition of Big Data is data not only large in volume, but all four v's: volume, as in sheer amount of data; variety, as in types of data; velocity, as in the rate at which the new data is gathered and updated; and veracity, or the validity of the data. Data could have large volume, but if there is a lot of repeated values and perhaps many zeroes, the data is actually very simple to process. The bigness comes from the difficulty to process the data which derive from the four v's.
